# Flashbang (HDR) Discord Theme

I heard you crying that the light theme is too bright. But I don't think so - here's a TRULY BRIGHT Discord theme (requires a HDR capable monitor).

## Usage

[Download flashbang.theme.scss](flashbang.theme.css)

Use any Discord theme loader (Vencord, BetterDiscord, Stylus in browser) to load the theme.

Open **Settings**, go to **Appearance** tab

Switch to **Light** theme (regular, not any of the Nitro ones)

## Customize brightness

Edit this value in `flashbang.theme.css`

```css
:root {
    /* Adjust brightness here */
    --hdr-base-factor: 1;
```
